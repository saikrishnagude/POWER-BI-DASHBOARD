# POWER-BI-DASHBOARD
Hello Everyone 🙏 ,
I am happy to share data analytics dashboard on Microsoft Power BI.

Overview of the Project: 
HR (Human Resources) is essential to the smooth and effective operation of every corporation.

I examined the reasons behind employee attrition (leaving the company) in the project.
 
#Insights: 
1) There are 1470 employees in the organization; 237 of them left the company, and the attrition rate is also somewhat high.
2) The employee's age, years, and average salary are 37, 7, and 7K, respectively.
3) The majority of employees receive 5K in attrition pay.
4) The majority of turnover occurs among employees between the ages of 26 and 35.
5) The minimum staff attrition is less than two years.
6) The majority of laboratory technicians leave the organization due to lower wages.
7) Life science employees are increasingly being digitized through learning.
